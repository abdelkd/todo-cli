# Todo-CLI

## What's this?
Just yet-another-todo-project but I took time to use cobra for making CLI apps and implement a way to use models.
in short models are a way to manage data storage, so as long as you implement proper functions for `Model` interface and a way to set it up then you're good to go.

## What I learned so far

- File management
- working JSON
- working with cobra
- how to use interfaces
- working with time
